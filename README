Welcome to Micityviewer
=================================

Getting Started
---------------------------------

This is an assignment that allows users to view cities and perform crud operations on them
as well as check the distance between any two cities.

How to Run
===========

- If you want to run this locally, make sure you have activator 1.3.12 installed and simply run activator run in the project root.

- For a live demo, go to https://micityviewer.herokuapp.com/ to see this in action.

- If you want to run the javascript tests locally, use the command ./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha


To see how my REST api is set up, look at the routes file.

Have fun
